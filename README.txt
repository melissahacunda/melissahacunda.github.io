For my website, I wanted to make it interactive for the person visiting my site, while still reflecting my personality into the siteâ€™s navigation and overall appearance. My loading page features a monochromatic animated pattern that I hope will feature some of my main pieces once I continue working on my site over break and into next semester. My resume carries this same fascination with patterns as seen with the hover effect of the buttons on the left; the backgrounds of the buttons feature a pattern that completes itself during a hover. I hope to further research how to design for screen-based devices in the future as I would like to incorporate app development into my senior thesis project.
At the beginning of the semester, I struggled with diverging away from making my pages look like a rudimentary list with bullet points. However, as I began to feel more comfortable with what I learned in class, my work started to shift and really take on a life of its own. I am grateful to have learned so much in just one semester and I cannot wait to continue expanding my knowledge of this vast coding world.
